		<h1>Maddie Lees: Response to As We May Think</h1>
		<p>First of all, I could not believe that this article was written in 1945. The extent to which it rings true to our generation's experience with technology is both comforting and frustrating to me, because it means that (a) there is some foundation for the conversations that my friends and I have about how overwhelming technology can be, but also that (b) we as a species are still struggling with the same essential question of this article, 60 years later: which is, How do we keep up with the technology we have created? We're not slowing down, even as some people have been aware (since 1945!!) that we as humans are limited in our capacity to take in everything that is becoming available to us. I'm not anti-progress or anti-knowledge, by any stretch, but I'll admit that the pace at which we're accelerating - the pace at which new information is 'popping up' and becoming available to all of us - can be kind of overwhelming!
		</p>
		<p>Two sentences in particular really stood out to me, thematically: "The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workersâ€”conclusions which he cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial." Besides the author's superior articulation, I feel like this excerpt could have been taken from any number of conversations I've had with my peers about how overloaded we feel sometimes. We have a wealth of information available to us, which is wonderful and, in some ways, makes life a lot easier -- but along with the accessibility of this information comes the expectation that we are able to sift through it with ease, which is not always true. I believe that addressing this dilemma and working toward solutions to it will be hugely beneficial to the developed world.
